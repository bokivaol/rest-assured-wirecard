# Rest-assured-TestNG-Gradle

1. To run tests on Windows using Cmder run the following command:
`gradlew test`

2. If you want to run tests using IDE, my suggestion is to use IntelliJ IDEA.

**Note**: All tests are located in "BeeceptorTests" class under "apiTests" folder:
`src/test/java/com/beeceptor/tests/apiTests/BeeceptorTests.java`
