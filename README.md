# Rest-assured-TestNG-Gradle

Clone project from GitHub:

`git clone https://github.com/bokivaol/rest-assured-wirecard.git`

Or simply [download a zip](https://github.com/bokivaol/rest-assured-wirecard/archive/master.zip) file.

1. To run tests on Windows using Cmder run the following command:

        gradlew clean test

2. If you want to run tests using IDE, my suggestion is to use IntelliJ IDEA.

**Note**: All tests are located in "BeeceptorTests" class under "apiTests" folder:

    src/test/java/com/beeceptor/tests/apiTests/BeeceptorTests.java
